Your home world is dying. The constant expansion of humanity resulted in the destruction of ecosystems and drainage of natural resources. After years of failing to find a way to rekindle the planet, the leaders of Rinnore had to look for other ideas. Ideas that involved abandoning our home, instead of saving it. We poured our remaining resources into developing a means of faster than light travel, in the hopes of finding a suitable planet to call home.

After a decades worth of scanning and expeditions, we finally found it. Planet Neron A-6. It was right in front of us the whole time. This sector was one of the first we scanned, however due to the first generation systems being unreliable, we misinterpreted the data. We implemented the second generation of scanners and reanalyzed this sector. Upon doing so, we discovered our salvation.

Right in the goldilocks zone of Star System A-6 was a small planet roughly half the size of Rinnore. Our scans show that there is an abundance of surface level water and a healthy concentration of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Unfortunately it seems that while the surface is teeming with flora and fauna, our scans are unable to provide a clear image of the surface due to the thick atmosphere. This is where you come in.

You are a soldier, a member of an elite group of Rinnoreians tasked with protecting the colonists and ensuring that the planet and landing zone are hospitable.

Your mission is to make landfall and provide a clear and stable environment for our landing ships. Something attacks your ship during landfall, resulting in you making an emergency ejection. Upon ejecting, you notice hordes of monsters and ruins dotting the landscape. You radio this information to your captain, who halts the remainder of the dropships in an abundance of caution. Now you're stranded on a hostile planet, teaming with creatures that want to kill you with nothing to defend yourself with. Time to put your training to the test.
